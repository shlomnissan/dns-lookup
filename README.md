# üåç dns-lookup

This repository contains a simple CLI tool that makes DNS queries. This tool is written in modern C++ and uses BSD sockets directly to send a request to your local DNS server and parse a response. It's built for educational purposes, but I created logical abstractions and included some unit tests and error handling.
